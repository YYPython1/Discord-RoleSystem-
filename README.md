# Discord-RoleSystem

Hello guys ! 

This is a simple RoleSystem, which gave u an option to give role for a certain time to member. 

Example: someone donate your server money or boost your server and you want to give him speficic role without counting when hes role will expire you can do that simple with this System. 

Commands: 

;role @Member time - Giving a role for time you said in command.
;unrole @Member - Removing role and giving him default role. 

Example commands:

;role @YYPython1^ 20s - @YYPython1^ has been promoted for 20s time. 
;unrole @YYPython1^ - @YYPython1^ has been demoted.

Message after roles expires ( you can edit it code however u want ):

@YYPython1^ The role you got expired, We gonna demote you now !

For this you need to have:

Default discord role: Member / Player 
Speficic role which is higher than: Member / Player Role.
Bot Role: Bot need's to be higher than Speficic role and Player role and he needs to have 'MANAGE Roles' Permissions so he could do this commands. 

Package: 

npm install ms
